# Release Notes

## Version 0.2

This represents our work after sprint 2 in which we primarily focused on the development of the UI experience. We added animations for the cards, background music and images, & designed the page where the cards are interpreted. We also added a welcome page to greet the user instead of directly presenting them with cards. The application is now more appealing UI wise.

Outside of the actual code, we have also made progress with our CI/CD pipeline. We now have JSDocs generating & a Code Climate badge displayed on our repository. We attempted to look into deployment in terms of packaging into a web app or using Netlify or Heroku, but we were largely unsuccessful in doing so. As of right now, we are deploying with Github Pages.

There are still improvements to be made & bugs to be fixed, but we are close to a final product.

## Version 0.1

This release represents our success at creating a Minimum Viable Product which emulates our vision for how this project is supposed to look like. We have the basic functionality of displaying the 5 tarot cards and then allowing the user to flip them and eventually receive their fortunes.

As of right now, there is little to no animations or UX/UI design. In further releases, we seek to improve on the UI and make it both prettier and more user friendly.
