# Release Notes

## Version 0.1

This release represents our success at creating a Minimum Viable Product which emulates our vision for how this project is supposed to look like. We have the basic functionality of displaying the 5 tarot cards and then allowing the user to flip them and eventually receive their fortunes. As of right now, there is little to no animations or UX/UI design. In further releases, we seek to improve on the UI and make it both prettier and more user friendly.

For source code, see our [release tag](https://github.com/cse110-sp23-group25/tarot-cards/releases/tag/Beta).
