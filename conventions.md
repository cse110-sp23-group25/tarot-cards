# Style Conventions

## Folder Layout
- HTML within the /HTML folder
- CSS within the /CSS folder
- JavaScript within the /JS folder
- Assets (Images, etc) within the /assets folder

## Branching
- Each sprint will be different. Depending on what we are working on in a specific sprint, have a new conversation and decision each week. For instance, if multiple of us are working on similar features, work on the same branch. Otherwise, if there is not much overlap on the tasks, make your own branch.

## Comments
- Comment areas of code which may be confusing (comment with purpose, not just for the sake of commenting)
- Adhere to JSDoc before all functions

## Naming
- camelCase variables throughout code
- Variable names should be indicative of their purpose (i.e. one should be able to infer the purpose of a variable merely from its name); Commonly accepeted variables like str and i are okay if used in relevant context
- Constants should be declared at the top of the file and in ALL CAPS and underscores; should be used in place of "magic values" to allow for easy modification in the future
- camelCase functions throughout code
- Files should be in all lower-case with spaces being replaced by dashes (-)
