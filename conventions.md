# Folder Layout 
- HTML within the /html folder
- CSS within the /css folder
- JavaScript within the /js folder
- Assets (Images, etc) within the /assets folder

# Branching
- HOLD

# Comments
- Comment areas of code which may be confusing (comment with purpose, not just for the sake of commenting)
- Adhere to JSDocs before all functions

# Naming 
- camelCase variables throughout code
- Variable names should be indicative of their purpose (i.e. one should be able to infer the purpose of a variable merely from its name)
  - Commonly accepeted variables like str and i are okay if used in relevant context
-  Constants should be declared at the top of the file and in ALL CAPS and underscores
  - Constants should be used in place of "magic values" to allow for easy modification in the future
- camelCase functions throughout code
- Files should be in all lower-case with spaces being replaced by dashes (-)
