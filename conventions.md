## Folder Layout
- HTML within the /html folder
- CSS within the /css folder
- JavaScript within the /js folder
- Assets (Images, etc) within the /assets folder

## Branching
- HOLD

## Comments
- Comment areas of code which may be confusing (comment with purpose, not just for the sake of commenting)
- Adhere to JSDocs before all functions

## Naming
- camelCase variables throughout code
- Variable names should be indicative of their purpose (i.e. one should be able to infer the purpose of a variable merely from its name); Commonly accepeted variables like str and i are okay if used in relevant context
- Constants should be declared at the top of the file and in ALL CAPS and underscores; should be used in place of "magic values" to allow for easy modification in the future
- camelCase functions throughout code
- Files should be in all lower-case with spaces being replaced by dashes (-)
